# rename-html-to-aspx
## conf2sp.py
A Python script to rename .html files to .aspx and replace links inside those files.

Replace /path/to/your/html/files with the actual path to your HTML files. This script will recursively search for .html files, rename them to .aspx, and update any links within the files.

Remember to test this script on a small subset of files first to ensure it behaves as expected before applying it to your entire content.

## pub2sp.ps1
A PowerShell script that accomplishes the tasks you mentioned: uploading HTML files to SharePoint libraries, setting permissions, and configuring site structure.

Make sure to replace the placeholders (https://yourtenant-admin.sharepoint.com, https://yourtenant.sharepoint.com/sites/YourSite, C:\Path\To\Your\HTML\Files, Your SharePoint Group, etc.) with your actual values. Additionally, adjust the permission level and site structure commands according to your needs.

Remember to install the SharePoint Online Management Shell and PnP PowerShell modules if you havenâ€™t already.
